### 🚀 About Me

I’m an **Aspiring Data Analyst** passionate about exploring data, identifying trends, and transforming findings into actionable insights.
With hands-on project experience using **SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit)**,
I enjoy bridging logic and creativity — finding meaning in data and communicating it through impactful dashboards and visuals.

I’m always curious to understand *why* something happened and *how* it came about, so I can identify *what* to do to either reinforce or correct it — turning curiosity into clarity and clarity into action.
